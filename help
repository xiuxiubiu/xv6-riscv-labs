[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
     [1mscript[0m [[1m-adkpqr[0m] [[1m-F[0m [4mpipe[24m] [[1m-t[0m [4mtime[24m] [[4mfile[24m [[4mcommand[24m [4m...[24m]]

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     The [1mscript[0m utility makes a typescript of everything printed on your terminal.  It is useful for students who need a
     hardcopy record of an interactive session as proof of an assignment, as the typescript file can be printed out later with
     lpr(1).

     If the argument [4mfile[24m is given, [1mscript[0m saves all dialogue in [4mfile[24m.  If no file name is given, the typescript is saved in
     the file [4mtypescript[24m.

     If the argument [4mcommand[24m is given, [1mscript[0m will run the specified command with an optional argument vector instead of an
     interactive shell.

     The following options are available:

     [1m-a[0m      Append the output to [4mfile[24m or [4mtypescript[24m, retaining the prior contents.

     [1m-d[0m      When playing back a session with the [1m-p[0m flag, do not sleep between records when playing back a timestamped
             session.

     [1m-F[0m [4mpipe[24m
             Immediately flush output after each write.  This will allow a user to create a named pipe using mkfifo(1) and
             another user may watch the live session using a utility like cat(1).

     [1m-k[0m      Log keys sent to the program as well as output.

     [1m-p[0m      Play back a session recorded with the [1m-r[0m flag in real time.

     [1m-q[0m      Run in quiet mode, omit the start, stop and command status messages.

     [1m-r[0m      Record a session with input, output, and timestamping.

     [1m-t[0m [4mtime[24m
             Specify the interval at which the script output file will be flushed to disk, in seconds.  A value of 0 causes
             [1mscript[0m to flush after every character I/O event.  The default interval is 30 seconds.

     The script ends when the forked shell (or command) exits (a [4mcontrol-D[24m to exit the Bourne shell (sh(1)), and [4mexit[24m, [4mlogout[24m
     or [4mcontrol-D[24m (if [4mignoreeof[24m is not set) for the C-shell, csh(1)).

     Certain interactive commands, such as vi(1), create garbage in the typescript file.  The [1mscript[0m utility works best with
     commands that do not manipulate the screen.  The results are meant to emulate a hardcopy terminal, not an addressable
     one.

[1mENVIRONMENT[0m
     The following environment variables are utilized by [1mscript[0m:

     SCRIPT
            The SCRIPT environment variable is added to the sub-shell.  If SCRIPT already existed in the users environment,
            its value is overwritten within the sub-shell.  The value of SCRIPT is the name of the [4mtypescript[24m file.

     SHELL  If the variable SHELL exists, the shell forked by [1mscript[0m will be that shell.  If SHELL is not set, the Bourne
            shell is assumed.  (Most shells set this variable automatically).
